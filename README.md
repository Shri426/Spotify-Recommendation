Project Overview:
In this project, we will use a dataset containing user listening history and song information from Spotify. We will build a recommendation system using machine learning techniques to suggest songs to users based on their past listening behavior and other features such as song popularity, genre, and artist information. The project will be divided into several phases, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model building, evaluation, and deployment.

Dataset:
The dataset used for this project contains the following information:

User listening history (user ID, song ID, play counts, etc.)
Song information (song ID, title, artist, genre, popularity, etc.)
You can download the dataset from Spotify API.

Setup
Before running the code, make sure you have the necessary libraries and dependencies installed. You can set up a virtual environment and install the required packages using the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Data Preprocessing:
Data preprocessing involves cleaning and transforming the raw data into a format suitable for machine learning. This step may include handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

Exploratory Data Analysis:
EDA is crucial for understanding the dataset and extracting insights. We'll visualize the data, analyze song popularity, user behavior, and explore correlations between different features.

Feature Engineering:
Feature engineering is the process of creating new features or modifying existing ones to improve the model's performance. We may generate features like user preferences, artist embeddings, and song embeddings.

Model Building:
We'll implement various recommendation algorithms, such as collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid models. We'll use libraries like scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch to build and train these models.

Evaluation:
To evaluate the recommendation system, we'll use metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and precision-recall curves. We'll also consider user satisfaction and engagement as qualitative metrics.

Deployment:
Once we have a satisfactory model, we can deploy it as a web application or integrate it into an existing platform. Flask or Django can be used for web deployment, and APIs can be created for easy integration.

Conclusion:
In this project, we aim to build an effective music recommendation system using machine learning techniques. The final system should provide personalized song recommendations to users based on their music preferences.
